# Reinforcement Learning

In this project, we aim to find the optimal policy for the Frozen Lake problem using Dynamic Programming methods (Policy Iteration, Value Iteration) and the Temporal Difference method (Q-Learning).

## Notebooks

Here you will find three notebooks:

* **`0.0Principal_RL_FinalNotebook.ipynb`**: Contains the main theory, initial exploration of the environment, and primary results.
* **`0.1_RL_FinalNotebook_convergenceTime.ipynb`**: Implements convergence methods and compares their performance.
* **`0.2_RL_FinalNotebook_dilemma.ipynb`**: Discusses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the Q-Learning algorithm.

### Who may be interested

Why three notebooks? As a beginner, I was cautious about potentially disrupting code that was already working, so I created copies to implement new ideas safely. Thank you for your understanding.
